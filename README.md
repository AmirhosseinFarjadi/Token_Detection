# Token_Detection
In this project, which is designed by Python programming language, we intend to simulate the token detection operation by DFA machine using language defined tokens.

The program user puts the phrase you want in 1.txt and executes the program, the program uses the defined tokens, checks the user input using the DFA machine and reports the detection of token types in file 2. Saves txt.

In the following, we will examine some inputs and outputs of the program.
These inputs include a function that consists of different sections such as variable definition, loop, condition and comparison operators, comments, etc. The output can be seen in the image below.
